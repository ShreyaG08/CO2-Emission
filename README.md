**CO2 Emission **

About Dataset
This dataset contains information about various vehicles' carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and fuel consumption.
In the context of Machine Learning (ML), this dataset is often used to predict CO2 emissions based on vehicle characteristics or to analyze fuel efficiency of vehicles.
The goal could be to predict CO2 emissions or fuel consumption based on the features of the vehicles.
There are total 935 rows and 12 columns.

1.Model_Year: Year of the vehicle model.
2.Make: Manufacturer of the vehicle.
3.Model: Specific model of the vehicle.
4.Vehicle_Class: Classification of the vehicle (e.g., Compact, SUV).
5.Engine_Size: Size of the vehicle's engine in liters.
6.Cylinders: Number of engine cylinders.
7.Transmission: Type of transmission (e.g., AM8, AS10).
8.Fuel_Consumption_in_City(L/100 km): Fuel consumption in the city.
9.Fuel_Consumption_in_City_Hwy(L/100 km): Fuel consumption on highways.
10.Fuel_Consumption_comb(L/100km): Combined fuel consumption.
11.CO2_Emissions: Target variable for the model, indicating CO2 emissions in grams per km.
12.Smog_Level: Indicator of smog level produced by the vehicle.
